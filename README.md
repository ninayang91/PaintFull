# PaintFull
Given a point in Color[][] screen, paint the bulk area to the new color

Implement the "paint fill" function that one might see on many image editing programs. That is, given a screen (represented by a two-dimensional array of colors), a point, and a new color, fill in the surrounding area until the color changes from the original color.

x, y axis is screen[y][x] in array

use recursion, if it is the old color, paint the point and the four surrouding, then the surrouding's surroudings
